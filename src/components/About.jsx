              Our products are crafted exclusively from the dreams and screams
              of young kids who wanted to show their mastery in their chosen
              fields, but were directed towards a factory for daily wages. Each
              cracker bursts brighter than their lost smiles, and can be heard
              louder than their cries for miles. Buy them, burst them, brag
              about them.
